Hi
The terrace garden is also called a roof garden, it is a garden in which vegetables,
flowers, and fruits are grown on terraces, balconies or roofs of buildings.
The kitchen garden, a normal in every Indian household,
has now shifted to the roof due to constraints of space and is known as a terrace garden
