Plants: Nutrients are essential for the growth of plants. If you want to harvest fruits and vegetables from the garden then you have to use natural fertilizer.
Bags: When you are maintaining bags in a terrace garden, keep adding sand, bran, husk, compost, and vermicompost to ensure that air and water remain in the bag.
Pots: If you have a small terrace and your plants are closely packed then you need to ensure to water and fertilize the plants at least twice a day.
